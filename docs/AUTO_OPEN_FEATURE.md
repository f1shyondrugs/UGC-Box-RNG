# Auto-Open Feature

## Overview
The Auto-Open feature is a premium gamepass-protected functionality that allows players to automatically open crates and manage their inventory with intelligent auto-selling capabilities.

## Requirements
- **Auto-Open Gamepass (ID: 1290860985)**: Players must own this gamepass to use the feature
- **Sufficient funds**: Players need enough R$ to purchase the selected crates
- **Crate selection**: A crate must be selected in the main UI before auto-opening begins

## Location
The Auto-Open button is located to the left of the navigation panel, alongside other UI elements. It's always visible but functionality requires the gamepass.

## Features

### Auto-Opening Settings
- **Crates to Auto-Open**: Set how many crates to open automatically (1-100)
- **Stop Below R$**: Set a minimum currency threshold to stop auto-opening
- **Auto-Sell Below Size**: Automatically sell items smaller than the specified size (1-10)
- **Auto-Sell Below Value**: Automatically sell items worth less than the specified R$ amount
- **Auto-Sell Mutations**: Select specific mutations to automatically sell

### Smart Auto-Selling
The system automatically evaluates each item received and sells it if it matches any of these criteria:
- Item size is below the threshold
- Item value is below the threshold  
- Item has a selected mutation for auto-selling

### Settings Persistence
All settings are saved locally and restored when the player rejoins the game.
